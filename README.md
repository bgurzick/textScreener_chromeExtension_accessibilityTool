IDEA: SIMPLE TEXT SCREENER - Google Chrome Extension

- WHY IT'S NEEDED
        those who struggle with visual attention can have a hard time reading and comprehending large blocks of text on the web.
- WHO IT HELPS
        this demographic can include those with ADHD, Aphasia, Learning Disability, Brain Injury or various other disorders; however, anyone can benefit from using a text screener, especially if they are tired or mentally fatigued
- CONCLUSION
        the successful design and execution of this text screener improves web accessibility and aids general learning


CURRENT STATUS (25 June 2024)

- screener function works
- upon extension activation, the screener bar appears at the bottom of the viewport
- upon click, the screener can be moved up or down with the drag of the mouse
- the task bar custom icon successfully renders

- Issues
    - once the extension is activated on a website, I cannot seem to deactivate it
    - once the screener has been clicked to enable the drag function, I cannot seem to deactivate the drag function
    - the drag operation is not intuitive. It sort of works inversely to what the brain is expecting.
    - the chrome extension menu icon is not rendering

- Considerations for future development
    - is it worth considering side bars as well, to block what is commonly visually cluttered ad space?
        - or just top and bottom? some websites have large sticky headers
    - what would it take to make the screener automatic? by which I mean to make it so that, when the screener is activated, it wraps directly around the body of the webpage

PRIOR STATUS (23 June 2024)

- screener function does not work
- I adjusted from 4 bars to a single bar at the bottom of the viewport
- upon extension activation, the bar appears on the bottom, but its height is too small
- once the extension is activated, it cannot be deactivated
- upon click, the screener can be dragged down, but not up; dragging down is not helpful
- once the click and drag feature is activated, it cannot be deactivated

PRIOR STATUS (22 June 2024)

- screener function does not work
- upon extension activation, the 4 different screener bars (Left, Right, Top, Bottom) obscure the entire screen and modify content
- the click and drag operation does not work
